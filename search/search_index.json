The 14th International Workshop on Vaccine and Drug Ontology Studies will be held along with the 16th International Conference on Biomedical Ontology (ICBO 2025). This year, we extend our focus to encompass artificial intelligence's transformative role in drug and vaccine ontology research. The workshop aims to explore innovative solutions and challenges in representing and analyzing drugs and vaccines, covering administration, immune responses, adverse events, and more. Key topics include the ontological representation of drugs and vaccines, real-world application challenges, drug components, administration, immune responses, drug interactions, and adverse events in clinical and research settings. A special emphasis will be placed on how AI can revolutionize ontology studies, enhancing literature mining, meta-analysis, and complex data interpretation. Despite progress, challenges remain in fully representing and utilizing ontologies for research and clinical issues, such as detailed representation of administration and adverse events, drug interactions, and analysis of immune responses. The workshop will bring together experts from clinical, research, and pharma-biotech sectors to discuss solutions to these challenges, aiming to foster advancements in drug development, administration, and the integration of AI in ontological research. Our goal is to contribute to public health improvement by enhancing the understanding and application of drug and vaccine ontologies.

The biomedical ontology community has tirelessly worked to refine health and clinical terminology systems, including lay medical terminologies, to encapsulate the complexities of drugs and vaccines. This year, we are extending our scope to include the pivotal role of artificial intelligence in advancing our understanding and application of drug and vaccine ontologies. Our workshop will delve into innovative solutions and persisting challenges in developing and utilizing biomedical ontologies for the representation and analysis of drugs and vaccines. This encompasses their administration, immune responses, adverse events, and more. We aim to cover two primary domains: the ontology representation of drugs (including vaccines) and the practical applications of these ontologies in real-world scenarios, such as administration protocols and adverse event tracking. Topics will include drug components, administration specifics, immune responses, drug interactions, and adverse events across both research and clinical settings. A significant addition to this year's workshop is the exploration of how artificial intelligence (AI) can revolutionize the field. AI offers unprecedented opportunities for literature mining, meta-analysis, and the interpretation of complex data sets, facilitating a deeper understanding of drug and vaccine interactions, adverse events, and more. This integration of AI into ontological studies represents a leap forward in our collective capability to manage and analyze biomedical information. Despite notable advancements, the journey is far from over. We still face considerable challenges in achieving comprehensive and logical representations of drugs and vaccines and in leveraging ontologies to address research and clinical inquiries effectively. These challenges represent administration details, adverse events, drug interactions, the experimental analysis of immune responses, and overcoming time constraints. By convening a diverse group of experts from clinical, research, and pharma-biotech backgrounds, this workshop will serve as a beacon for proposing and debating solutions to these ontological challenges. Our discussions will not only cover drug development and administration but will also pioneer the integration of AI technologies to enhance our methodologies and outcomes. In essence, the role of drugs and vaccines in public health cannot be overstated, and through the collaborative efforts of the biomedical ontology community, significant strides have been made in their representation. The 13th VDOS workshop at ICBO 2025 will further this mission, addressing both enduring and emerging challenges in the ontology of drugs and vaccines, with a special emphasis on the transformative potential of artificial intelligence.","title":"VDOS Introduction"},{"location":"vdos_intro/#international-workshop-on-vaccine-and-drug-ontology-studies-vdos","text":"Drugs and vaccines continue to be cornerstones in improving public health worldwide.
