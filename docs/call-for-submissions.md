# VDOS 2025 Call For Submissions 

The 14th International Workshop on Vaccine and Drug Ontology Studies will be held along with the 16th International Conference on Biomedical Ontology (ICBO 2025). This year, we extend our focus to encompass artificial intelligence's transformative role in drug and vaccine ontology research. The workshop explores innovative solutions and challenges in representing and analyzing drugs and vaccines, covering administration, immune responses, adverse events, and more. Key topics include the ontological representation of drugs and vaccines, real-world application challenges, drug components, administration, immune responses, drug interactions, and adverse events in clinical and research settings. A special emphasis will be placed on how AI can revolutionize ontology studies, enhancing literature mining, meta-analysis, and complex data interpretation. Despite progress, challenges remain in fully representing and utilizing ontologies for research and clinical issues, such as detailed representation of administration and adverse events, drug interactions, and analysis of immune responses. The workshop will bring together experts from clinical, research, and pharma-biotech sectors to discuss solutions to these challenges, aiming to foster advancements in drug development, administration, and the integration of AI in ontological research. Our goal is to contribute to public health improvement by enhancing the understanding and application of drug and vaccine ontologies.

Submission to journal: **JBMS** (continuous; [https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/vdosseries](https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/vdosseries))<BR>
Alternatively, submission to **EasyChair**: [https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=vdos2025](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=vdos2025)<BR>

We suggest that you submit your papers directly to JBMS if you think your paper meets the journal paper quality. Please follow the JBMS paper submission instructions, and remember to select the **[JBMS VDOS collection](https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/vdosseries)** link (Note: the collection is labeled as **vdosseries**, but it can still be used for vdos2025 submission). Please note that there is no guarantee that the journal submission will be reviewed before the workshop. If the journal submission is not reviewed in a timely manner, the authors may be asked to submit an abstract to EasyChair so that they may still be able to present the paper in the workshop.  

If your paper is more preliminary but is suitable for the conference presentation, we suggest you submit it to our **[EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=vdos2025)**. For the EasyChair submissions, all selected full-length papers and short papers will be invited to submit a full revised version to the Journal of Biomedical Semantics (JBMS) VDOS Special Issue. The conference paper format for EasyChair submission will be the same as the format used in ICBO. Contributions must be delivered non-anonymously and as a single PDF file, following the CEUR-ART [template.docx file](https://icbo-conference.github.io/icbo2025/papers/CEUR-Template-1col.docx), single column. There is also an Overleaf Template available [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/wqyfdgftmcfw).<br>

## Submission Format
For the **[EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=vdos2025)** paper submission, we will allow three submission formats:<BR>
•	full research papers (6-8 pages) format<BR>
•	work in progress / late-breaking results (2-3 pages), and<BR>
•	a statement of interest (one page) for podium presentation.<BR>

All full-length (6-8 pages) and short-length (2-3 pages) submissions will go through peer reviews by at least two reviewers. The workshop organizers will review the one-page statement-of-interest submissions. 

### Journal of Biomedical Semantics (JBMS) journal VDOS Collection
As mentioned above, all accepted full-length and selected short papers will be invited to submit a fully revised version to the JBMS VDOS Collection. Alternatively, authors may submit their full-length papers directly to the JBMS VDOS collection at any time (continuous; [https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/vdosseries](https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/vdosseries)). The JBMS Editorial Office conducts an initial quality check on all submitted manuscripts. The VDOS organizers will then handle the review process and may invite some authors to present at the upcoming VDOS workshop, even if their manuscripts are not accepted for publication. It should be noted that there is no guarantee that submissions to the journal will be reviewed and feedback will be received before the workshop. Submissions made directly to JBMS should adhere to the [JBMS guidelines](https://jbiomedsci.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines). Please note that JBMS does not impose strict limits on the length and page count of manuscripts.
