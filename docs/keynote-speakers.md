## Title: 
Application of Ontology at the US Food and Drug Administration: A Use Case on Secondary Pharmacology

## Description: 
This presentation will give an introduction to the use of ontology and controlled terminologies at the US Food and Drug Administration. Additionally, secondary pharmacology will be presented as a use case where adding ontology and other types of structured data may benefit both regulatory review and research.

## Affiliation: 
Senior Scientific Advisor, US Food and Drug Administration

## Bio: 
Dr. Rebecca Racz is a Senior Scientific Advisor in the FDA’s Office of Clinical Pharmacology.  She currently leads multiple projects in the office, including knowledge management and process improvement initiatives.  Dr. Racz is a pharmacist by training and received her BS in Biomolecular Science (2013) and PharmD (2016) from the University of Michigan.  She joined FDA’s Division of Applied Regulatory Science in 2016 and was the primary investigator on multiple research projects focusing on secondary and safety pharmacology, natural language processing, and database development.  She has published over 30 papers, serves as the lead for numerous international collaborations, and won the 2021 FDA Outstanding Junior Investigator Award. <br><br>

Chris Stoeckert, Ph.D., is a Research Professor of Genetics and faculty in the Institute of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pennsylvania. Although originally a biophysicist and then a molecular and cell biologist, he has spent most of his career working on databases supporting the mining of complex datasets. These have included databases on gene expression, orthologous proteins, pancreatic development, Alzheimer’s Disease genomics, and multiple resources for the NIAID VEuPath Bioinformatic Research Center supporting research on eukaryotic pathogens and vectors, including the associated ClinEpiDB and MicrobiomeDB. The database work led to involvement in the development of data standards such as MIAME (Minimal Information About a Microarray Experiment), MAGE-TAB format standard for reporting microarray experiments, and the development of biomedical ontologies such as the MGED Ontology. He is a founder and developer of the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI), has led the development of the Ontology for Biobanking (OBIB), and serves on the OBO Foundry Operations Committee. He is faculty director of the TURBO (Transforming & Unifying Research with Biomedical Ontologies) project at Penn aimed at semantic harmonization and integration of clinical data.
